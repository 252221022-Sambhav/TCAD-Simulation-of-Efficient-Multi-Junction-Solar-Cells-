# TCAD-Simulation-of-Efficient-Multi-Junction-Solar-Cells-
Working on Silvaco TCAD-based device simulation of multi-junction solar cells. Initial work includes modeling a dual-junction InGaP/InP structure on Silvaco ATLAS, achieving 32.38% simulated efficiency. Currently exploring triple-junction architectures (InGaP/GaAs/InP) to enhance spectral absorption and overall performance.
